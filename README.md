## Fake News Detection on Social Media:

### Overview:
As we know how fake news on social media about Hilary Clinton had a big impact on election results.  The cost of publishing information in public is very low and the efficiency of spreading news through social media is very high. 

These benefits can also enable spread of low-quality news with false or fake information. 
During 2016 USA presidential election, one of the most escalating news was the one that claimed Hillary Clinton ordered the murder of an FBI agent and was viral on social media.

### Motivation and Background:

The extensive spread of fake information on social media.
When social media has become the most cost-efficient way of communication among people, it is extremely intriguing to analyze peopleâ€™s reactions to a popular news post while eliminating false information online. Therefore, designing a news monitor system that concentrates on the news content to alert the public about fake news.

### Goals:

- Guiding people on their thinking over false information.
- Identifying fake news over social media.
- Building a classifier to predict news as a Real or Fake.
